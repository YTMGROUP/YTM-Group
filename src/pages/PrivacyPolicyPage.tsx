                  The Privacy Act includes a Notifiable Data Breaches ('NDB') scheme which requires us to notify you and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner ('OAIC') of certain data breaches and recommend steps you can take to limit the impacts of a breach (for example, a password change).

                  The NDB scheme requires us to notify about a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm to affected individuals. There are exceptions where notification is not required. For example, where we have already taken appropriate remedial action that removes the risk of serious harm to any individuals.

If you believe that any personal information we hold about you has been impacted by a data breach, you can contact us.
